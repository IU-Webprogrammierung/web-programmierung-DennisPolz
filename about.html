    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> I am a multidisciplinary designer. I love cooking and I enjoy sports. 
        Meeting interesting individuals or visiting beautiful places on this 
        wonderful planet is what motivates me to create.
        I am fascinated and inspired by a wide range of topics, including fashion,
        the human mind, music, health, architecture and new technologies.</p>
    <p> My previous roles required a wide range of different competencies, 
        which I used to develop and expand my multidisciplinary skill set. 
        I am skilled in user experience, prototyping, interface design, design systems, 
        brand identity, research, digital and print design, and presentations. 
        In addition, I  have a decent knowledge of sound design, photography, CMS, 
        cutting and social media. I excel at connecting the dots and 
        finding the missing pieces. I am passionate about learning new things.</p>
    <p> I have had the privilege of working with a number of high-profile clients, 
        including Porsche, Senec, the Goethe Institute, Xella, Kuka, 
        Schaeffler Automotive, Traton SE, Kaut, Hisense, Panasonic and 
        Rheinische Post Mediengruppe. I have written articles and shot a cover
        picture for a major daily newspaper, produced songs for small local and 
        global artists, created social media strategies and graphics, designed 
        an app for business travellers, constructed a tunnel monitoring system, 
        published magazines and created visual media for events in Singapore and 
        Tenerife.</p>
    <p> I am driven by a desire to create tangible, meaningful experiences 
        and sustainable products that last.</p>
