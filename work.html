<P>The task was to develop a unified software system for the monitoring and control 
    of highway tunnels for the for the Highway Authority. The software enables operators 
    to coordinate technical malfunctions and emergencies, as well as maintenance and 
    rescue operations, from a central location. They can switch between tunnels, and 
    additional monitors display images from surveillance cameras in different configurations. 
    Sensors in the tunnel collect data and trigger alarms if unusual values are detected. 
    Both automatic and manual control of tunnel functions is possible. </P>
<P>After extensive research, user groups were identified and their needs were summarised in 
    User Need Statements. These included primary users such as operators, indirect users such 
    as the Highway Authority, emergency services, road maintenance and drivers. 
    Based on these groups, i created four concrete personas. The development of the interaction
    concept involved the identification of three action scenarios and the creation of user flows,
    which were then consolidated into a flowchart. Wireframes were sketched and 
    system requirements were defined and prioritised. A key task was to develop a 
    comprehensive design system for the software.</P>
